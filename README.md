# The-Passenger
Short point and click horror game developed for the 2021 edition of the Global Game Jam.

## Description

It's 2 A.M. You are about to go home after a grueling day of work with a ridesharing app. 

Or so you thought. 

A sound coming from the backseat draws your attention: a lost phone. Since you didn't go too far, you decide to go back to the last passenger's home and return it. 

It was just supposed to be a quick ride. But these things never go as planned...
